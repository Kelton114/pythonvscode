Barcelona are Europe's most embarrassing football club!,2024-05-25,"As the half-time whistle blew at Barcelona's La Liga clash with Rayo Vallecano on Sunday, the chants started: ""Xavi si, Laporta no,"". Everything was very clear: the cules - who are required to vote on the club's president at every election cycle - aren't so convinced with the man at the helm.

And they have a point. It's been a chaotic week in Catalunya, as rumours spread that Laporta wanted to sack manager Xavi, just weeks after begging the disgruntled boss to remain at the club past this summer.

Official confirmation followed on Friday afternoon, with Laporta telling Xavi - one of Barca's most legendary players - that his services would no longer be required next season during a meeting at the club's training ground. Former Bayern Munich boss Hansi Flick is expected to replace him.

The news has reopened some old wounds that had seemingly been sewn shut after a discombobulated campaign. The president pulled an ultimate act of reconciliation in April in getting Xavi to stay, but after changing his mind and getting rid of him, Laporta has only further damaged the reputation of Europe's most poorly run elite club.

The footballing world hardly needed any more proof, but the setup at Barca is an absolute mess - and it could yet get worse before it gets better."
Liverpool should be looking at Lloyd Kelly to solve defensive issues,2024-05-25,"So, the Jurgen Klopp era is over at Anfield - and a new one is about to begin. Arne Slot will officially take up his new role as Liverpool head coach on June 1, and he'll be inheriting a squad that his predecessor has left in fine fettle.

The Reds may have run out of steam during the tail end of the 2023-24 campaign, but it was a season of real progress, with Klopp winning the Carabao Cup with kids before leading Liverpool back into the Champions League - and all of this after overhauling his midfield last summer.

So, what can we expect from the Merseysiders during the upcoming window? They've not only got a new coach, 'laptop guru' Michael Edwards is back involved, this time as Fenway Sports Group's CEO of football, while Richard Hughes is on his way from Bournemouth to take over as sporting director.

All three will be looking to stamp their mark on Liverpool's squad, and while FSG are famed for their prudence, it is believed that there could be as much as £200m (including salaries and agent fees) to spend this summer. Below, GOAL explains where the money might go..."
‘The Garfield Movie’ is more like a stale snack than a fancy feast,2024-05-25,"(CNN
 — 
Given Garfield’s long history it’s hard to imagine a film about the corpulent cat that feels as if it’s made for almost nobody, but “The Garfield Movie” limbos under the bar. Big and loud, with animated action aimed at kids, the film also loads up references to things like “Mission: Impossible,” “Top Gun” and “Fargo” and still manages to feel as stale as a week-old lasagna left out too long in the summer.

Part heist movie, part family reunion, the film draws upon the most salient characteristics of the flabby feline, but mostly as an excuse to build a story that seems to crawl further from its origins with every passing frame. A bevy of star voices (Chris Pratt leading the way in the title role, along with Samuel L. Jackson) can’t enliven a project that, creatively speaking, exhausts at least four or five of its nine lives.

Peaking during a pre-credit sequence, the film introduces a big-eyed baby Garfield (those plush toys aren’t going to sell themselves) who gets abandoned by his dad, Vic (Jackson), a resourceful outdoor cat, and taken home by Jon (Nicholas Hoult), who even adopts Odie the dog to keep him company.

Flash forward several years, and the grown and well-fed Garfield has his suburban bliss upended when he’s abducted (catnapped?) by Jinx (Hannah Waddingham, in a mini-“Ted Lasso” reunion with Brett Goldstein as one of her hench cats), using him as bait to lure Vic out of hiding and exact revenge."
"‘Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga’ delivers plenty of action, just not as furiously as its predecessor",2024-05-25,"(CNN
 — 
In a sign of its priorities – action over character, production design over story – Anya Taylor-Joy doesn’t even show up until roughly an hour into “Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga.” Then again, the movie’s namesake is really less the star than the dystopian Wasteland that she must navigate, which serves as the backdrop for an undeniably muscular sensory assault that’s a bit malnourished as an origin-story detour off “Fury Road.”

Director/co-writer George Miller again infuses his film with a manic energy essentially designed to power through its narrative shortcuts. The frenetic and visceral nature of that yields a series of elaborate chases with relatively modest connective tissue holding them together.

Spending almost as much time with younger versions of Furiosa as Taylor-Joy, the already-tough girl is quickly abducted from a haven called the Green Place – “a place of abundance,” as one of the raiders describes it – and taken to the warlord Dementus, played by Chris Hemsworth with an over-the-top lustiness that puts Thor to shame, even before factoring in the amusingly nasty prosthetic nose.

Motivated by revenge and exposed to all the horrors the Wasteland can offer, Furiosa winds up operating among the three fortresses of that unyielding world, including one, the Citadel, presided over by the Immortan Joe (Lachy Hulme), the nightmare-faced heavy who also appeared in 2015’s Oscar-winning “Fury Road.”

After a strong start, the action becomes a bit repetitive. And while the Mad Max series has never exactly been known for its intricate plotting, the centerpiece of those movies – “The Road Warrior” – built a credible foundation, stakes and framing device for the high-octane violence."
‘The Beach Boys’ catches the Boomer wave of golden-oldie music documentaries,2024-05-25,"(CNN
 — 
Streaming has yielded bounties in numerous areas, but nowhere more than in the field of music documentaries catering to Baby Boomers. Those projects have also been enriched not just by nostalgia for great acts but by weaving their soundtracks into the evolution of the culture through tumultuous times in the 1960s and ‘70s.

Add two more projects to that tally this week: “The Beach Boys,” an ode to the band that gave the world the surf sound and whose members, among other things, crossed paths with the Manson family; and “Stax: Soulsville USA,” HBO’s multi-part look at the Memphis music label that championed such artists as Otis Redding and Isaac Hayes.

These productions have caught a different kind of wave, following “The Beatles: Get Back” and Peter Jackson’s more recent restoration of the Fab Four’s “Let It Be” on Disney+; “Paul Simon: In Restless Dreams” (MGM+); Netflix’s “The Greatest Night in Pop,” about the recording of “We Are the World” in 1985; “Thank You, Good Night – The Bon Jovi Story” (Hulu), and many more, among them an upcoming Cyndi Lauper documentary, “Let the Canary Sing,” on Paramount+.

Despite advertisers’ historic emphasis on reaching younger viewers, streaming services also rely on subscriptions, and Baby Boomers’ money is as green as everybody else’s. Beyond appealing to that demo, the documentaries create the opportunity to introduce these acts and their music to newer generations, while providing fresh insights for those weaned on them.

“The Beach Boys,” in particular, feels like a logical companion to Disney+’s material on the Beatles, given the extent to which the two bands competed and fed off of each other’s triumphs. As USC professor and cultural historian Josh Kun notes, the relationship between the bands was as much a collaboration as a rivalry, with Beach Boys songwriter/producer/troubled genius Brian Wilson drawing inspiration from John Lennon and Paul McCartney’s creative output, and McCartney heralding Wilson’s towering accomplishment, “Pet Sounds,” as near perfection.

Fueled by interviews with the surviving members, directors Frank Marshall (whose work in this space included “The Bee Gees: How Can You Mend a Broken Heart”) and Thom Zimny (a frequent Bruce Springsteen collaborator, including “Letter to You”) also enlist other musical luminaries to weigh in on the Beach Boys’ influence and significance."
